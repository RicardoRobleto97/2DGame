Project no: 6 - FINAL

Project due date: 5/2/2018
	
REQUIREMENTS: 
	1 - Game Meets Conclusion
		- This was done in two ways. If the player dies, then a game over screen shows.
		- If the player shoots all of the enemies, a win screen shows. Both options provide a way back to the menu.
	
	2 - Music and Sound
		- I used sounds from the repo to make shooting and explosion effects.
		- I found a song online that has a space techno vibe to play in the background.

	3 - Restart Option
		- If the player dies or shoots all the enemies, the player will have the option to return back to the menu.
		- Once at the menu, the player can select play again, or the player can quit.

	4 - God Mode
		- If the user so desires, there is an option to play in God Mode from the start menu.
		- While in God Mode, the player's collision detection is turned off.
		- However, you can still blast away all of the baddies to get to the win screen.

	5 - Video
		- A 20 second video is provided to show the new menu and restart option.

	6 - Crash Rarely - Leak Free
		- I don't ever see my game crash, but I am assuming that once I get up in front of everyone to present
			- it will start crashing...
		- On the topic of memory leaks: I ran mine against the restart example from the repo and get the same
			- amount of reachable bytes and lost bytes at the end of the execution. I assume this is acceptable.

	8 - Pizzazz
		- Since my game is pretty difficult, I chose to implement a menu where you can see the controls,
		- choose between normal and god mode, and restart the game. This way, players do not have to struggle
		- trying to stay alive and read the controls at the same time. Also, this allows an interface to build
		- upon after the semester is over.
